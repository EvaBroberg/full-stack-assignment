# Odin Project Deployment Plan (with AWS)

## Prerequisites

- **AWS Infrastructure**: Ensure you have AWS infrastructure in place, including EC2 instances or AWS Fargate for Docker, an S3 bucket for hosting, and an RDS database for data storage.

- **Domain and SSL Certificate**: If you plan to use a custom domain, make sure you have purchased it and configure SSL certificates for secure communication using AWS Certificate Manager.

- **Git Repository**: Host your Odin project code on GitHub.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild for automated deployments.

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
- SSH into your development environment.
- Clone your Odin project repository from GitHub.

### Step 2: Dockerize Your Backend (Optional)
- Dockerize your FastAPI backend by creating a `Dockerfile`.
- Build and push the Docker image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

### Step 3: Set Up CI/CD Pipeline
- Create a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild.
- Configure the pipeline to build and deploy the Dockerized backend and React frontend to your AWS environment.

### Step 4: Configure AWS Resources
- Set up AWS resources like Amazon RDS for the database and an S3 bucket for hosting static files.

### Step 5: Environment Variables
- Configure environment variables for your FastAPI backend, including database connection details and any secret keys, using AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store.

### Step 6: Production Rollout
- Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk or AWS Fargate to deploy your Dockerized backend.
- Deploy your React frontend to an S3 bucket configured for static website hosting.

### Step 7: Test the Deployment
- Access your Odin application through the custom domain or the AWS resources.
- Verify that the map loads with the specified coordinates, SAR image overlay, lighthouse locations, and ship position.

### Step 8: Backup and Monitoring
- Set up automated backups for your RDS database.
- Implement monitoring and alerting using AWS CloudWatch to ensure application availability.

### Step 9: Auto-Scaling (Optional)
- Depending on usage, configure auto-scaling policies for your AWS resources to handle increased traffic.
